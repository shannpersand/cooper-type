		<h1>RoboChrome</h1>
		<h2>Color Font Support in Systems and Applications</h2>
		
		<p>All formats can be tried out in the free <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/content/blogcategory/40/364/">FontLab Pad</a> application.</p>
		
		<h3>Adobe/Mozilla (SVG)</h3>
		
		<p>The SVG format is known to work in recent Firefox versions on all platforms. Other applications will display the normal black-and-white glyphs as a fallback.</p>
		
		<h3>Microsoft (COLR/CPAL)</h3>
		
		<p>Fonts with the COLR/CPAL tables work in Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1. Other applications will display the normal black-and-white glyphs as a fallback.</p>
		<p>The Adobe/Mozilla and Microsoft formats can live together in one font without interfering with each other.</p>
		
		<h3>Mac OS/iOS (sbix)</h3>
		
		<p>The sbix format is supported on Mac OS X 10.7+ and iOS. The color glyphs are only displayed when the fonts are installed in the system, not as web fonts. There are no fallback glyphs, applications which donâ€™t know the format will display empty glyphs. Applications that use the system text rendering (e.&nbsp;g. Word 2011) will use the color glyphs, while applications with their own rendering engine (e.&nbsp;g. Adobe Creative Suite) display empty glyphs.</p>
		
		<h3>Google (CBDT/CBLC)</h3>
		
		<p>Support for the CBDT/CBLC tables is not implemented yet, and application support is unknown.</p>
