# Delete PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH
# These are set when the FDK command scripts are called from
# another Python interpreter, such as from a script run within Robofont.
# This causes Python modules to be loaded from the other interpreter's libraries,
# and can cause stack-dumps when these libraries are incompatible with modules in the
# AFDKO Python interpreter.
# Under Yosemite ( Max OSX 10.10) the calling app needs to be run from the command-line (e.g:
# “open /Applications/RoboFont.app“
# and the subprocess call needs to have the argument "shell=True" added.
# Example: log = subprocess.check_output("makeotf -u" , stderr=subprocess.STDOUT , shell=True)
